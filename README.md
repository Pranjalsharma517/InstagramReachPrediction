# DataAnalysisProjects
This repository includes projects related to domain of Data Engineering.

Summary:
This is a sample project of Instagram Reach Analysis Using Python. this project we can predict our reach of instagram posts with machine learning using python.
If a content creator wants to do well on Instagram in a long run, they have to look at the data of their Instagram reach. That is where the use of Data Science in social media comes in. 

Prequisite:
1.To run in local system we require jupyter notebook installed in our PC.
2.After creating a new notebook start the python-kernel.
3.Start with importing basic libraries.
 -> numpy (for working with arrays) 
 -> pandas (for series and dataframe)
 -> matplotlib (for data visualisation)
 -> seaborn (built on top of matplotlib and integrated with pydata)

4. Read data in dataframe.

The dataset can be downloaded from here :
https://statso.io/instagram-reach-analysis-case-study/

5. check for null values in dataset.

6. Analyze Instagram Reach using plots with different parameters.(say checking impressions with captions, with likes etc.)

7. Analyze Content that you post on Instagram how well it reach to user.
 -> we have technique to sum up all the words all together and size of data indicating its frequency or importance.(WordCloud)
 
8. Install wordcloud in your notebook by using following command
!pip install wordcloud.

9. Analyzing relationships to find most important factors of our instagram reach and analyze the frequency.
-> check with different coordinates say impressions with likes.

10. Analyze Conversion Rate means how many followers you gained from number of profile visits from a post.

11. Instagram Reach Prediction Model, by creating a model feed the data and resulted out the respective predicted impressions.
